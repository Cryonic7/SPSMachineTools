# SPS Machine Tools Repository

This is a repository for a script made in powershell that includes tools for users of Seattle Public Schools computer systems so that they may change their background and use other customization options that are blocked by default

No part of this script is Malicious, nor is it meant to break or bend the rules of the network in anyway, or to spread malicious files to SPS computers, it is made simply for use by regular users to be able to do what most can do automatically at other schools

To download, navigate to the releases tab and download the latest version in zip file, unzip to location of your choice, and read the included README for further instructions
